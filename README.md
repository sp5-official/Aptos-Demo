# NFT Profile Badges

## Description

NFT Profile Badges is a smart contract built on the Aptos blockchain that allows users to mint and manage unique profile badges as NFTs. Each user can create a personalized badge with a custom name and icon, which serves as a digital identity marker on the platform. The contract ensures that each user can only hold one profile badge at a time, making each badge unique to its owner.

The smart contract implements a simple yet effective system for digital identity representation, where users can showcase their achievements, status, or personal branding through customizable NFT badges.

## Vision

Our vision is to revolutionize digital identity and social recognition in the Web3 ecosystem by providing a decentralized platform for profile badges. We aim to create a system where:

- **Digital Identity**: Users can establish and showcase their unique digital presence through personalized NFT badges
- **Social Recognition**: Community members can display achievements, roles, or status through verifiable on-chain badges
- **Decentralized Ownership**: True ownership of digital identity markers without reliance on centralized platforms
- **Interoperability**: Badges that can be recognized and utilized across different dApps and platforms in the Aptos ecosystem

## Future Scope

### Phase 1: Enhanced Badge Features
- **Multiple Badge Support**: Allow users to hold multiple badges for different purposes (achievements, roles, memberships)
- **Badge Metadata**: Extended attributes including descriptions, rarity levels, and creation timestamps
- **Badge Categories**: Implement different types of badges (achievement, membership, role-based, etc.)

### Phase 2: Social Features
- **Badge Trading**: Marketplace functionality for trading rare or special badges
- **Badge Verification**: Community-driven verification system for authentic badges
- **Badge Leaderboards**: Rankings and statistics based on badge collections

### Phase 3: Advanced Functionality

- **Badge Staking**: Utility features where badges can be staked for rewards
- **Cross-Chain Compatibility**: Bridge functionality to other blockchain networks
- **DAO Integration**: Governance features where badge holders can participate in decision-making

### Phase 4: Ecosystem Integration
- **API Development**: RESTful APIs for easy integration with external applications
